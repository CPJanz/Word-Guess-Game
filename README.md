# Word Guess Game
In the spirit of the cartoon, Who's that Pokemon challenges the player to guess which of the original 151 pokemon the computer has chosen. 

## Description of Play
The player guesses a letter by pressing that key on their keyboard, if that letter is in the chosen pokemon's name, that letter will be revealed on the game board, otherwise they will lose a life. If the pokemon's name is fully revealed before the player runs out of lives they win! Otherwise they lose.

## Purpose
This was an assignment for coding bootcamp focusing on javascript objects and working with the DOM by manipulating page elements.

## Potential Future Updates
- Update the Javascript to use jQuery.
- display an image of the chosen pokemon when it is guessed (much like the cartoon).
- Add sfx
- Animate pokeballs turning into letters when guessed.
- When a repeat letter is pressed, highlight that letter (which will either be revealed in the word or in the incorrect letters list).
- When a game is lost, reveal the unguessed letters and highlight them.

## Feedback
I found the challenge to contain the game in an object a good way to force me to organize the code. I continue to find working with bootstrap a challenge which I take to mean that I need more practice with it (and with css in general). 

I welcome any feedback on the choices I made (especially on the html and css side).
